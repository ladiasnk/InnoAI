# InnoAI- Power the Era of Articial Intelligence
A machine learning 3 day school that I participated organised by IEEE CAS in the Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki
The school included talks from experts related to several aspect of ML and AI circuits and applications. Outstanding speakers with years of experience academically and professionally in these fields. In addition, to tutorial-like lectures the school includes one day with hands-on lab on ML applications with MATLAB. All the files are compatible with MATLAB 2021 version. Each file inclued data for a given specific task in a machine learning application, from extracting and **organizing the given data**, to **classifiying** and **analyzing them** or even performing **Principal Component Analysis** and **fitting them in proper distributions**, finally a **neural network approach** was also presented. The files are separated in chapters as presented in the hands-on lab exercise we were given to participate. There is for each chapter alive script(.mlx) file containing the full solution on the code we were asked to complete in the corresponding AUTH.mlx file.
